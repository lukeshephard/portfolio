### https://lukeshephard.com
This is my website I made mostly just to keep my projects organised and to write a bit about them.

## Accessing the website
The project can be accessed at https://lukeshephard.com, or it can be downloaded and accessed locally.

### Instructions using npm:
To run locally, first clone or download the repository, then run 'npm install' in the directory to install all of the required packages.

You can either run the website as a development server or as a static build:
- To run a local development server, run 'npm run dev'.
- To create a static build, run 'npm run build' then use a package like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to locally run the build in the 'out' directory.

## Pages
**Home:** The first page that will show on the website, just a place to share some facts about myself.

**Projects:** All my projects are shown here, they can be sorted using the various boxes if you're looking for something in particular. Clicking a project will take you to a page with more information about it, and ways to view it if it has any.

**Socials:** Just to show my few socials and my email if I need to be contacted.
